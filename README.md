## Overview

Lunar Tunes aims to provide an immersive music streaming experience while focusing on the importance of design and user interface. The project combines the following technologies and concepts:

- **Figma**: Design principles and user interface (UI) design are explored using Figma. The UI design is an integral part of the project, and Figma serves as the tool for creating visually appealing components and animations.

- **SVG Animations**: Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are used to create captivating animations for various elements of the application. These animations enhance the user experience and add an element of delight.

- **Java Spring**: The backend of Lunar Tunes is built using Java Spring. It handles music streaming and provides the necessary APIs for the frontend to interact with.

- **React TypeScript**: The frontend is developed using React with TypeScript. It's responsible for rendering the user interface, playing music, and interacting with the backend to stream music seamlessly.

## Features

- Cool looking colors and design made with Figma.
- Engaging SVG animations
- Music streaming powered by Java Spring.
- Neat little React TypeScript frontend.
- Easy-to-follow installation steps (thank you ChatGPT).

## Getting Started

To get started with Lunar Tunes, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): JavaScript runtime for running the frontend.
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/): Package manager for JavaScript.
- [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html): Java Development Kit (JDK) for running the backend.
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/): Build automation tool for Java projects.

### Installation

1. Clone the Lunar Tunes repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/lunar-tunes.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the frontend directory and install the frontend dependencies:

   ```shell
   cd lunar-tunes/frontend
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React TypeScript frontend:

   ```shell
   npm run dev
   ```

4. In a separate terminal window, navigate to the backend directory:

   ```shell
   cd lunar-tunes/backend
   ```

5. Run the Java Spring backend:

   ```shell
   gradle bootRun
   ```

Now, you should have both the frontend and backend running, and you can access the Lunar Tunes application in your web browser.

## Usage

Open your web browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the view the application. The play button is in the top right corner by the way.
